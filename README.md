## Description

The **Andalusian varieties of [Spanish]** (Spanish: *andaluz*; Andalusian) are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla, and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties, and also from Standard Spanish. Further info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_Spanish.

This application provides with a basic transliteration tool, using [andaluh-py](https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-py) package. Further info: https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-py

**PLEASE NOTICE** andalu-minecraft performs and automatic transliteartion from spanish to andaluz, hence all english, acronym or non spanish words will be wrongly transliterated. We encourage you to manually review all files transliterated.

The original es_ES.json file (minecraft spanish) can be downloaded from https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft
The result of this work is released under https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft/esan
